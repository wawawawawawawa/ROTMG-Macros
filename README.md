# RotMG macro
This ahk script allows you to create a hotkey for several macros :

Single Click = Heal Me macro

Double Click = Thanks macro

Triple Click = Good Luck macro

You can change the hotkey in the macro.INI file (open it with Notepad)

You can also add/delete the texts in the macro.INI file

By default, the hotkey is Numpad9

You can open macro.AHK file if you downloaded AutoHotkey (https://autohotkey.com/download/), otherwise you have to run the macro.EXE (which is the ahk file compiled)
